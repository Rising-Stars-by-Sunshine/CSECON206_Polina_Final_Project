## Background/Motivation:

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into strategic decision-making processes poses significant challenges to traditional game theory frameworks. In this project, we aim to develop a novel approach to government project allocation using game theory principles. The decision-making process involves representatives from three parties, who allocate preferences to projects across four fields (economy, social policy, environment, culture), ranking them from most to least important. However, the dynamic nature of interactions in environments involving both human and AI agents presents unique challenges that existing game-theoretic models struggle to address effectively.

## Research Questions:

What methodologies can effectively model strategic interactions in dynamic environments involving both human and AI agents?
How can reinforcement learning and Bayesian game theory enhance adaptability and efficacy in strategic decision-making processes?
What role does AI play in optimizing project allocation processes and maximizing overall welfare?
These questions are important because they address the fundamental challenges posed by the integration of AI into strategic decision-making processes, particularly in the context of government project allocation. Existing game theory literature may not fully account for the complexities introduced by AI agents' adaptive behavior and learning mechanisms.

## Application Scenario:

Our newly proposed game and solution concept apply to real-world scenarios such as government project allocation. The literature in psychology provides a behavioral foundation for understanding decision-making processes, including human biases and social dynamics, which can inform the design of our game-theoretic framework.

## Methodology:

We build upon traditional game theory frameworks and integrate elements of reinforcement learning and Bayesian game theory to address dynamic environments with adaptive agents. Advanced computational tools and techniques, including simulation-based methods and statistical inference, are applied to analyze and evaluate the performance of our proposed methodologies. Insights from artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computational economics are integrated into existing methods to smartly solve research questions.

## Preliminary Results:

Our Bayesian cake-cutting game framework demonstrates improvements in fairness and efficiency compared to traditional methods, particularly in government project allocation scenarios. By considering the diverse preferences of stakeholders and utilizing Bayesian inference, our approach optimally allocates resources and maximizes welfare.

## Intellectual Merits and Practical Impacts:

Limitations of our current research inspire future exploration into more sophisticated multi-agent interactions and strategic decision-making processes. Our methodologies can be applied to improve individual, company, and government decisions in strategic scenarios, empowering stakeholders to make informed choices in complex environments. Additionally, our research contributes to the advancement of AI-driven approaches in game theory and mechanism design, fostering a future where human and artificial intelligence can collaborate effectively in decision-making processes.
