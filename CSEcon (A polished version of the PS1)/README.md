## QUESTION 1
### When computer science meets economics: Who do you truly want to become? Pick one of your favorite Nobel Prize winners (https://www.nobelprize.org/) and Turing Award winners (https://amturing.acm.org/). How do you want to contribute to the intersection of the two north stars to advance human civilizations? 

I aspire to connect my life and career with diplomacy and traverse the intricate web of international relations with finesse and insight. My aspirations are firmly rooted in my dedication to promoting world peace and harmony. I aim to leverage my multidisciplinary background in international relations, history, policy studies, and computer science to illuminate pathways toward a more tranquil world. Through meticulous research and impassioned advocacy, I seek to cultivate a nuanced understanding of geopolitical dynamics, recognizing the challenges and opportunities that abound in our interconnected world. With each endeavor, I endeavor to inch closer to the noble pursuit of peace, aspiring to one day stand among those honored with the Nobel Prize for Peace. This ambition is not merely personal but stems from a profound conviction that positive change is within our grasp, awaiting only the concerted efforts of dedicated individuals. While it is hard to select just one nominee for the Nobel Prize or the Turing Prize, I was deeply inspired and touched by the groundbreaking work of Vinton G. Cerf and Robert E. Kahn (Turing Award 2004) (Figure 1 and Figure 2) for inspiring leadership in networking and the design and implementation of the Internet TCP/IP protocol suite. As for the Nobel Prize of Peace, I find the Nobel Peace Prize 1961 awardee Dag Hammarskj√∂ld (Figure 3) inspiring and particularly effective in his respective time. He was awarded the victory posthumously "for developing the UN into an effective and constructive international organization, capable of giving life to the principles and aims expressed in the UN Charter‚Äù (The Nobel Peace Prize 1961). Both remarkable achievements mark ground in the modern world for developing digital diplomacy, cyber peacebuilding, and the global governance of the digital realm, where diplomacy and technology converge to address international issues in the modern era ‚Äî and I can contribute to these fields one day.

## QUESTION 2
### CS&Econ for a Better Future: How do you perceive the synergy between computer science and economics as a catalyst for steering innovation toward a brighter future? Please present a foundational assertion, followed by multiple specific instances that support your claim, including a reference to a topic discussed at the colloquium on Friday, March 22.

The fields of Computer Science and Economics combined to create a unique field for developments, which are already taking place in our world ‚Äî taking the recent panel with the industry leaders that just took place on Friday, 22nd of March. Hearing the insights of different companies united together to utilize technology for better economic and social development, I was inspired to learn about their company cases and the activities they pursue. One speech that stood with me was the speech of Greg Sun ‚Äî perhaps because I was lucky to get to hear his insights not once, but twice, referring back to the Microsoft Field Trip in November 2023. Hearing how Microsoft utilizes its findings and knowledge, attracts first-class specialists, and creates a platform for smaller companies and their direct competitors for collaboration and development is what stuck with me. Quoting Mr. Sun‚Äôs answer to my question about leveraging competition back in November ‚Äî ‚ÄúIf you cannot compete with them, collaborate with them‚Äù. Understanding the pursuits of global technology and industrial leaders sets the ground for younger generations (us, particularly) to join forces and continue the development of the economy with the assistance of technology together. While these are not my direct sphere of expertise, I was incredibly touched and inspired by Professor Bing Luo's current research on privacy elevation stemming from his industry experience (which I followed up afterward and learned about his research direction (Shao et al. 2024), and Professor Xin Tong‚Äôs (Tong et al. 2020) ongoing efforts to elevate experience of people disadvantaged through the application of HCI ‚Äî just referring to this examples, we can understand how technology can be leveraged in a positive way that can contribute to the development of both respective fields ‚Äî Computer Science and Economics.

## QUESTION 3
### Beyond CS & Econ: How are aspects of human nature, like bounded rationality, and pioneering technologies, such as generative AI, reshaping the dynamics between humans and AI agents in strategic contexts? Additionally, how might this interplay be perceived and conceptualized distinctively from current models? Address this inquiry by drawing upon the literature covered in our lectures and supplementary scholarly works, ensuring to include in-text citations and a comprehensive bibliography.

Focusing on the intersection of International Relations and AI, if you search through Google Scholar using key keywords ‚Äúinternational relations‚Äù, ‚Äúai‚Äù, the extensive research body would cover the potential threats AI poses for global security and peace for its extensive application ‚Äî informed by AI technologies playing a great role in modern security, where they are used both to enhance defense mechanisms against security threats and to develop more sophisticated offensive capabilities in the realm of warfare, raising concerns about stability and escalation in international relations, the navigation of automated weaponry (Bode and Qiao-Franco 2024) (Jensen et al. 2019). As one of the literature pieces we covered in class, the big question that arises in this intersection is rationality - to what extent is AI rational, and a potential answer might be in the findings of Chen et al. (2023) that claim that a certain part of AI, LLM (like ChatGPT), are rational in their decisions, which can give us an insight of AI rationality in general. A different question that is worth addressing pertains to AI training ‚Äî what happens if AI is trained irrationally? How is rationality evaluated in this complex field? (Figure 4)
